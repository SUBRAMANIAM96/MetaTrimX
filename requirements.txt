1. INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR USERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To ensure the pipeline runs correctly, follow these steps to install both the 
Python environment and the external bioinformatics tools.

Step A: Install Python Dependencies
MetaTrimX requires a specific set of libraries to handle machine learning and 
data processing. Run this command from your terminal within the MetaTrimX 
project folder:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Step B: Install External Bioinformatics Tools
MetaTrimX relies on industry-standard tools for sequence manipulation. These 
must be installed and accessible in your system's path ($PATH).

    1. Cutadapt (Primer & Adapter Trimming)
       Command: pip install cutadapt

    2. VSEARCH (Merging & Chimera Removal)
       Command: sudo apt install vsearch

    3. Fastp (Quality Diagnostics)
       Command: sudo apt install fastp


2. SCIENTIFIC NOTE ON VERSIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 'requirements.txt' file specifies exact versions for Scikit-learn and 
TensorFlow. This is critical because the serialized "Brain" (metatrimx_brain.pkl) 
is highly sensitive to version changes. 

If a different version of Scikit-learn is used, the model may fail to load or 
provide inaccurate predictions. Using these specific versions ensures that your 
environment is identical to the development environment, preserving the 
integrity of the AI’s logic.
